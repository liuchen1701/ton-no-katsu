I've read through the first 2 storyboards. Despite the text is a little bit hard to read, the storyboards did make perfect sense about what the apps are about and when they should be used. 
The ideas are great. The first one is a more interactive way of visiting the museum which also svaes time cost at the same time, and the second idea is nice in that visitors can view previous stories and pictures from visitors in the past, which really makes a difference.
