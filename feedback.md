I've read through the first 2 storyboards. Despite the text is a little bit hard to read, the storyboards did make perfect sense about what the apps are about and when they should be used. 
The ideas are great. The first one is a more interactive way of visiting the museum which also svaes time cost at the same time, and the second idea is nice in that visitors can view previous stories and pictures from visitors in the past, which really makes a difference.

For storyboard 5, the idea itself is definitely good, and is useful to almost everyone. However, this idea is in fact so good that has utilized by other products in the markets. I would suggest to elaborate this idea by targeting on a more specific user group. 
For story board 6, this idea is more realistic, both in uniqueness and feasibility. Just a suggestion, that this idea may be the best to be implemented as a mobile app rather than webapp.

For the third storyboard (for the image, rather than for the text description), it seems that the idea is about to find some excitng place to have fun that is rated as good by other users. This idea itself is not competent enough considering the existence of Google Map and Trip or other similar mature apps.

For the fourth one, it will definitely be useful, but localized map is hard to build, and the fastest path may vary depending on various factors. Make sure you can handle this idea or it  will be really difficult for you to implement.
