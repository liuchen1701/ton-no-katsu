I've read through the first 2 storyboards. Despite the text is a little bit hard to read, the storyboards did make perfect sense about what the apps are about and when they should be used. 
The ideas are great. The first one is a more interactive way of visiting the museum which also svaes time cost at the same time, and the second idea is nice in that visitors can view previous stories and pictures from visitors in the past, which really makes a difference.

For storyboard 5, the idea itself is definitely good, and is useful to almost everyone. However, this idea is in fact so good that has utilized by other products in the markets. I would suggest to elaborate this idea by targeting on a more specific user group. 
For story board 6, this idea is more realistic, both in uniqueness and feasibility. Just a suggestion, that this idea may be the best to be implemented as a mobile app rather than webapp.

For the third storyboard (for the image, rather than for the text description), it seems that the idea is about to find some excitng place to have fun that is rated as good by other users. This idea itself is not competent enough considering the existence of Google Map and Trip or other similar mature apps.

For the fourth one, it will definitely be useful, but localized map is hard to build, and the fastest path may vary depending on various factors. Make sure you can handle this idea or it  will be really difficult for you to implement.

Storyboard 4:
For the fourth storyboard, I really like this idea and believe that it is more advanced than what the current market is used to. I think you should carefully consider how to motivate user to start using this app, for example by having some type of creative UGC events. In addition, it sounds like that this app may be another a good AR physical geolocation sandbox mobile game, so you can consider focus more about the gaming part rather than the general information.

Storyboard 5:
The fifth one, the midpoint finder, is also a really useful tiny tool. However, make sure it can provide more benefits so that the user will not choose to just look into the Google Map and find the (obvious) mid point for meet-up.

Storyboard 6:
For the sixth one, there are privacy concerns and ethical concerns you should consider. How can you get the information of criminal record, and can you publicize those on map, and will this even affect someone's lives or offend someone's rights? With the above concerns, frankly speaking I will not suggest this idea.
