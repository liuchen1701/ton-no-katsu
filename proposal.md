# Project WorldRunner

An app aiming to visualize steps tracked into a more heuristically digestable way. Users can see how far they will go if their steps were taken on mountains or wonders.
Additional features like remote race in laps/mountains. Photography of selected wonders will unlock if steps reach certain amount.
