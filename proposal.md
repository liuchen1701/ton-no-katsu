# Project WorldRunner

# Description
An app aiming to visualize steps tracked into a more heuristically digestable way. Users can see how far they will go if their steps were taken on mountains, yosemite, or other wonders.
Additional features like remote race in laps/mountains. Photography of selected wonders will unlock if steps reach certain amount.

# Feedbacks
Generally, we had ideas of a real time parking finder service, a visual steps tracker, and a lost-and-found map.
Based on the feedbacks we had, we decided to abandon the lost-and-found service since it's limited and have credential issues.
For the parking finder service, thought it's a service highly in demand, it requires external data like real-time parking monitoring.


# Features
That's why we decided to settle down on visual steps tracker. It is obviously easier to implement, while at the same time being fun and useful, since humans were not born to interpret numbers, instead we were born to perceive images. Unlike other tracker apps that visualize steps as distance traveled, we are going to not only provide user with a clearer interpretation (progress on mountain climbing, sightseeing, marathon, etc.), but also related scenary photos. For example, if the user had took what's worht the distance halfway to climb Mount Himalaaya, he will be able to unlock a beautiful image of Himalaya-- that's just saying the example. For actual implementation, we can have more easier tracks like a lap around lake Tahoe, with richer resources for photos. This way, there will be a whole library waiting there for the user to unlock-- by their own steps. Thus, running is more fun with an aim and something to expect, and some people (like me) just can't resist the OCD to unlock all collectibles. The point is to make each track diverse as it could be, so that users don't get bored and will alwayes be happy to explore new scenaries with their footsteps.

For multiplayer, aka remote race, it will be the same idea. A leaderboard will be shown if the user feels lonely even with some frineds racing along-- but not all of it. To make it less frustrating, the user WILL get a world rank for the track, but what is shown in the end is the user, potential friend in the race, and 2 closest other users.
