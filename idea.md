# Team Ton No Katsu - COGS121 Project

## Project Ideas

### Parking Lot related

##### 1. Find the nearest parking lot and navigation
##### 2. Visualize the people flow / density of parking lots, so that it can suggest the user which one may be empier

### Public Restroom Map

##### 1. User-Generated-Content: user can upload the information of the public restroom
##### 2. User can view the nearby restrooms and be able to navigate to their locations

### Running Tracker

##### User can select an arbitrary track on map from one location to another, like from LA to SD, and share this track to other user. This recorder will record the participants' running history during a certain period, and users will be able to view their progress in terms of the track they selected.

### Lost-and-Found Map

##### When someone found something that has been lost by others, they normally will leave the lost item at the original place, but the one who lost things may not remember the exact location they lost their items. With this map, people who found something lost can upload the information about the lost item to map, and those who have lost items can check if those items belong to them.

### Geo-location Based Sceneric Place Guide

##### We grab the sceneric photos from websites with real location tags to determine which place could be the most attractive place. Then user can view the popular places's location, others' photos, and the navigation method to there.
